## üéØ Quick Execution Summary

**Minimum Required Cells**: 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 8

**Total Time Estimate**:
- Fast (GPU): ~15 minutes
- Normal (CPU): ~30 minutes

**Critical Cells**:
- **Cell 5**: Longest step (training)
- **Cell 6**: Creates model files
- **Cell 7**: Must succeed before Cell 8

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: "ML model not found"
**Solution**: Run cells 1-7 in sequence before cell 8

### Problem: Training too slow
**Solution**: In Cell 1, change `nrows=500000` to `nrows=100000`

### Problem: Out of memory
**Solution**: 
- In Cell 1: Reduce `nrows` to 100000 or 50000
- In Cell 5: Change `batch_size=256` to `batch_size=128`

### Problem: TensorFlow errors
**Solution**: Restart kernel and run cells 0-8 again

### Problem: Chess board not appearing
**Solution**: Make sure ipywidgets is installed and enabled in Jupyter

## üìä Expected Performance

After successful training:
- **MSE**: 15,000 - 25,000
- **MAE**: 80 - 120 centipawns
- **Training Accuracy**: Model should converge within 10-15 epochs

---

## üéÆ Playing the Game

Once Cell 8 is running:

1. **Select Mode**: "Vs AI" or "Two Players"
2. **Choose Color**: White or Black (if vs AI)
3. **Set Depth**: 2-5 (higher = stronger but slower)
4. **Click "Start/Reset"**
5. **Make Moves**: Click piece, then destination
6. **View Evaluation**: Status bar shows position score
