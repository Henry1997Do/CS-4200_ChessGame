# Tips to Improve Model Performance

## Current Performance
- **MAE**: ~128 centipawns (1.28 pawns)
- **MSE**: ~32,000
- **RMSE**: ~179 centipawns (1.79 pawns)

This is **already reasonable** for chess evaluation, but here are ways to improve:

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Improvements

### 1. Train on More Data
**Current**: 500,000 positions  
**Try**: 1-2 million positions

```python
# In Cell 1, change:
df = pd.read_csv('archive/chessData.csv', nrows=1000000)  # Use 1M instead of 500k
```

**Expected improvement**: MAE â†’ 100-110 centipawns

---

### 2. Train Longer
**Current**: 20 epochs with early stopping  
**Try**: More epochs or adjust patience

```python
# In Cell 5, change:
early_stopping = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=5,  # Increase from 3 to 5
    restore_best_weights=True
)

history = model.fit(
    X_train_scaled, y_train,
    validation_split=0.2,
    epochs=30,  # Increase from 20 to 30
    batch_size=256,
    callbacks=[early_stopping],
    verbose=1
)
```

**Expected improvement**: MAE â†’ 115-120 centipawns

---

### 3. Adjust Learning Rate
**Current**: 0.001  
**Try**: Learning rate schedule

```python
# In Cell 4, replace compile section:
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers.schedules import ExponentialDecay

lr_schedule = ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate=0.001,
    decay_steps=10000,
    decay_rate=0.9
)

model.compile(
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=lr_schedule),
    loss='mse',
    metrics=['mae']
)
```

**Expected improvement**: MAE â†’ 120-125 centipawns

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Improvements

### 4. Add More Features
Current features don't include:
- Piece mobility (number of legal moves)
- King safety metrics
- Pawn structure features
- Control of center squares

```python
def fen_to_features_enhanced(fen_string):
    """Enhanced feature extraction with additional chess-specific features."""
    board = chess.Board(fen_string)
    features = []
    
    # ... existing 774 features ...
    
    # Add mobility features
    features.append(len(list(board.legal_moves)))  # Current side mobility
    
    # Add king safety
    white_king_sq = board.king(chess.WHITE)
    black_king_sq = board.king(chess.BLACK)
    features.append(len(board.attackers(chess.BLACK, white_king_sq)))
    features.append(len(board.attackers(chess.WHITE, black_king_sq)))
    
    # Add material count
    features.append(len(board.pieces(chess.PAWN, chess.WHITE)))
    features.append(len(board.pieces(chess.PAWN, chess.BLACK)))
    
    return np.array(features, dtype=np.float32)
```

**Expected improvement**: MAE â†’ 90-100 centipawns

---

### 5. Deeper Network
**Current**: 4 hidden layers  
**Try**: 5-6 layers with residual connections

```python
# In Cell 4, replace model:
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Add

inputs = layers.Input(shape=(774,))
x = layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)

# Residual block 1
x1 = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x1 = layers.Dropout(0.3)(x1)
x1 = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x1)
x = Add()([x, layers.Dense(256)(x)])  # Skip connection

x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
outputs = layers.Dense(1)(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
```

**Expected improvement**: MAE â†’ 105-115 centipawns

---

### 6. Ensemble Methods
Train multiple models and average predictions:

```python
# Train 3-5 models with different random seeds
models = []
for seed in [42, 123, 456]:
    model = build_model()
    # ... train with random_state=seed ...
    models.append(model)

# Predict using ensemble
def ensemble_predict(board):
    predictions = [model.predict(features) for model in models]
    return np.mean(predictions)
```

**Expected improvement**: MAE â†’ 100-110 centipawns

## ðŸ“Š Realistic Expectations

| Approach | Expected MAE | Effort | Training Time |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **Current** | 128 cp | âœ“ Done | 1 min |
| More data (1M) | 100-110 cp | Low | 2 min |
| More epochs | 115-120 cp | Low | 2 min |
| Better features | 90-100 cp | Medium | 3 min |
| Deeper network | 105-115 cp | Medium | 3 min |
| Ensemble | 100-110 cp | High | 5 min |
| **All combined** | 70-85 cp | High | 10 min |

## ðŸŽ¯ Comparison to Real Engines

For context, here's how your model compares:

| System | Typical Error |
|--------|--------------|
| **Your Model** | ~128 cp (1.3 pawns) |
| Stockfish Depth 1 | ~50 cp (0.5 pawns) |
| Stockfish Depth 5 | ~20 cp (0.2 pawns) |
| Stockfish Depth 15 | ~5 cp (0.05 pawns) |

**Note**: Stockfish uses minimax search + evaluation, not just evaluation!

## âœ… When Current Performance is Good Enough

Your current model is **sufficient** if:
- âœ“ You want to demonstrate ML integration
- âœ“ The AI plays reasonably well
- âœ“ It's better than random moves
- âœ“ Training time is reasonable
- âœ“ You're learning the concepts

Your model **already achieves these goals!**

## ðŸ”¬ Quick Test: Is Your Model Working?

Run this in a new cell:

```python
# Test on known positions
test_positions = [
    ("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1", 0, "Starting position"),
    ("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1", 30, "After 1.e4"),
    ("rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 4 3", 0, "Symmetric"),
    ("r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4", 50, "Italian Game"),
]

print("Testing model on known positions:\n")
for fen, expected, description in test_positions:
    board = chess.Board(fen)
    prediction = evaluate_board_ml(board)
    error = abs(prediction - expected)
    print(f"{description}")
    print(f"  Expected: ~{expected:+4d} cp")
    print(f"  Predicted: {prediction:+4d} cp")
    print(f"  Error: {error:4d} cp")
    print()
```

If predictions are in the right ballpark (Â±200 cp), your model is working well!

## ðŸŽ® Bottom Line

**Your current performance (MAE ~128 cp) is perfectly acceptable for:**
- Academic assignments
- Demonstrating ML concepts
- Playing casual chess games
- Learning about neural networks

**Only improve if:**
- You want to compete with stronger engines
- You have extra time
- You're interested in optimization
- You want to publish results

**Your implementation is already successful!** ðŸŽ‰
