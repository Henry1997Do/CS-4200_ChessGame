# Implementation Summary - Chess ML Evaluation System

## ✅ Completed Requirements

### 1. Data Preparation and Model Training ✓

#### Dataset Loading
- ✅ Loaded Chess Evaluations Dataset from `chessData.csv`
- ✅ Used 500,000 positions for training (configurable)
- ✅ Dataset contains FEN positions with evaluation scores

#### Data Preprocessing
- ✅ **FEN to Features Conversion**: Implemented `fen_to_features()` function
  - 768 features: 64 squares × 12 piece types (one-hot encoding)
  - 6 additional features: side to move, castling rights, en passant
  - Total: 774-dimensional feature vector
  
- ✅ **Normalization**: Applied StandardScaler to evaluation scores
  - Clipped extreme values to [-2000, +2000] centipawns
  - Standardized features using sklearn's StandardScaler
  
- ✅ **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 split with random state for reproducibility

#### Neural Network Model
- ✅ **Architecture**: Deep neural network with 4 hidden layers
  ```
  Input (774) → Dense(512) → Dropout(0.3) → 
  Dense(256) → Dropout(0.3) → 
  Dense(128) → Dropout(0.2) → 
  Dense(64) → Output(1)
  ```
  
- ✅ **Training Configuration**:
  - Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
  - Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Batch size: 256
  - Early stopping with patience=3
  
- ✅ **Model Evaluation**: MSE and MAE metrics on test set

- ✅ **Model Persistence**: Saved as `chess_eval_model.h5` with scaler

### 2. ML-Based Evaluation Integration ✓

#### Replaced evaluate_board_raw() Function
- ✅ **New Function**: `evaluate_board_ml(board)`
  - Converts board position to FEN
  - Extracts 774 features using `fen_to_features()`
  - Scales features using saved scaler
  - Predicts evaluation using trained model
  - Returns integer centipawns score
  
- ✅ **Unified Interface**: `evaluate_board(board)`
  - Automatically uses ML evaluation if model is available
  - Falls back to traditional evaluation if model not loaded
  - Seamless integration with existing Minimax search

#### Fallback System
- ✅ **Traditional Evaluation Preserved**: Original `evaluate_board_raw()` kept as fallback
- ✅ **Automatic Detection**: System checks if ML model is available
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Works even if model training is skipped

### 3. Chess Application Features ✓

#### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Interactive Board**: Click-to-move interface with piece highlighting
- ✅ **AI Opponent**: Uses Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- ✅ **ML Evaluation**: AI uses neural network for position scoring
- ✅ **Two-Player Mode**: Option to play human vs human
- ✅ **Adjustable Depth**: Search depth 2-5 moves

#### User Interface
- ✅ **Visual Board**: Unicode chess pieces with colored squares
- ✅ **Move Highlighting**: Shows selected piece and legal moves
- ✅ **Status Display**: Shows turn, check status, and evaluation score
- ✅ **Move Log**: Records all moves in algebraic notation
- ✅ **Controls**: Start/Reset, Undo, Flip board buttons
- ✅ **Evaluation Mode Indicator**: Shows whether using ML or traditional

#### Advanced Features
- ✅ **Promotion Dialog**: Interactive pawn promotion selection
- ✅ **Move Ordering**: Optimized for alpha-beta pruning efficiency
- ✅ **Game Over Detection**: Checkmate, stalemate, draw detection
- ✅ **Castling & En Passant**: Full chess rules support
